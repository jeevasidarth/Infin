## Overview

InFin is a zero-paperwork income insurance platform built for Swiggy and Zomato delivery partners across Indian cities. Workers pay a small, personalised weekly premium. When a disruption hits their zone — floods, bandhs, heatwaves, cyclones — InFin's system detects it automatically, validates it through 3 data-driven gates, and transfers a fair payout directly via UPI, with a WhatsApp notification. No claim forms. No waiting.

## The Problem

| Pain Point | Reality |
|---|---|
| **Who it's for** | Swiggy / Zomato delivery partners in Indian cities |
| **Daily earnings** | ₹700 – ₹1,100/day |
| **Risk** | Income drops to zero during floods, bandhs, heatwaves, and riots |
| **Why existing insurance fails** | Expensive, tiered, one-size-fits-all, requires paperwork the worker can't afford to do |

---

## How It Works

### Engine 1 — Policy Pay

Each worker's weekly premium is computed individually from their verified platform earnings and their zone's historical disruption rate.

```
weekly_premium = ROUND(
  expected_daily_earnings
  × disruption_probability
  × conflict_ratio
  × 1.15 / 0.65
)

conflict_ratio = (workers paid in past 4 weeks) / (workers who claimed) [rounded to 1 decimal]
```

**Example — Rajan, Chennai**
- Daily earnings: ₹872
- Disruption probability: 0.0615
- Conflict ratio: 0.70

```
= ROUND(872 × 0.0615 × 0.70 × 1.15 / 0.65)
= ₹58 / week
```

Premium is collected weekly via Stripe. A **36-hour relaxation window** exists between the end of one policy week and the start of the next (i.e., a policy covering Day 1–7 can be renewed any time up to Day 8.5).

---

### Engine 2 — Policy Claim

No action required from the worker. The system runs daily and checks for disruptions automatically.

```
Gate 1 → DVS ≥ 0.70   (Was the disruption real?)
Gate 2 → ZPCS ≥ 0.35  (Was it zone-wide?)
Gate 3 → AEC = TRUE   (Was the event covered?)

All 3 pass → payout formula runs → UPI transfer
```

Payout is triggered and released only once the disruption parameter that caused Gate 1 to pass returns to normal (back below threshold) and the insurance ends.

---

## 3-Gate Claim Validation

### Gate 1 — Disruption Validity Score (DVS)

Checks only external API data (weather, AQI, IMD alerts). Weighs:
- **60%** — agreement across sources
- **40%** — how far the actual reading exceeded the threshold

**Pass condition:** DVS ≥ 0.70

---

### Gate 2 — Zone Peer Comparison Score (ZPCS)

Compares the claimant's delivery activity against all peers in the same pincode during the same window. If the disruption was real, most workers in the zone will show reduced activity.

**Pass condition:** ≥ 35% of zone peers are affected (≥ 40% drop in their deliveries)

---

### Gate 3 — Activation Eligibility Check (AEC)

A hard boolean check covering:
- Was the policy bought **before** the event was publicly announced?
- Is the worker outside the 6-hour refractory window for spontaneous events?
- Is the event outside the 72-hour known-event exclusion window?

**Pass condition:** AEC = TRUE

---

## Smart Payout Logic

Payout is not all-or-nothing. It compensates for what the worker **would have earned** minus what they **actually earned**, floored at 50% of their disrupted expected income.

**Weekly cap = 3× daily average earnings**

| Scenario | Payout |
|---|---|
| Worker didn't work | Floor amount (50% of disrupted expected income) |
| Worked but earned below floor | `floor − actual_earned` (tops up to floor) |
| Worked and earned above floor | ₹0 (already protected) |

**Example:**
- Expected: ₹800, 6-hour event → disrupted expected = ₹700, floor = ₹350
- If worker earned ₹100 → payout = ₹250 (total income = ₹350)

---

## Anti-Gaming Rules

| Event Type | Exclusion Rule |
|---|---|
| **Bandh / Strike** | Policy bought after public announcement of the bandh date is excluded for that event |
| **Cyclone** | Policy bought after IMD orange alert issuance is excluded for that cyclone |
| **Flood** | ML model predicts affected zones and days; policies bought after flood risk is confirmed are excluded for those specific dates and pincodes |
| **Spontaneous events** (riots, road closures, Section 144) | 6-hour refractory period — must be a policyholder at least 6 hours before the event started |
| **Known-event window** | If the disruption was already in the alert snapshot at subscription time and current time is within 72 hours of subscription, the claim is excluded |

---

## Loyalty Bonus — Chit Fund Model

Workers who pay continuously for 24 weeks (6 months) never truly "lose" their premiums.

| Scenario | Premium Return |
|---|---|
| No claims filed during full term | **80–90%** returned |
| Claims made during term | **30–40%** returned, scaled by claim frequency |

**Loyalty counter reset rules:**
- If a worker misses a weekly payment OR claims a payout during the term, the cumulative premium sum and transaction count reset to zero.
- Only an unbroken 24-week streak qualifies for the end-of-term settlement.

Settlement is triggered automatically upon plan completion and paid via UPI.

## End-to-End Claim Flow

```
External API detects disruption
        ↓
Gate 1: DVS computed
        ↓ (pass)
Gate 2: ZPCS computed
        ↓ (pass)
Gate 3: AEC verified
        ↓ (pass)
Disruption parameter returns to normal
        ↓
Payout calculated
        ↓
UPI transfer to worker
        ↓
WhatsApp notification sent
```

All steps are fully automated. Workers are notified via WhatsApp at each stage.
